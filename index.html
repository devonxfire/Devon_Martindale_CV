        <h3>Hi there! Thanks for checking out my profile. Just a quick summary of what I'm all about:</h3>
        <br>

        <p>I love the creative challenges that come with the media industry that I've been involved in for over
            a
            decade.
            I was a Content Production Manager for a GPS tour guide company, creating audio content and managing
            projects
            for bus and tour operators all over the globe.
            I run a small audiobook publishing company called 'Audioshelf', producing digital audiobooks for
            local and
            international publishers and authors around the world.
            I have a keen interest in software engineering and development, building up my skills with Java,
            Python,
            databases and other software projects and development.
            I am passionate about music; while playing guitar in my punk rock band based in Cape Town. I have
            worked on
            many sound studio-related projects,
            including producing albums for local bands and editing and mixing final audio mixes for big-name
            broadcasters
            such as Red Bull and Supersport.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Hyperion Development</h3>
        <h4>Certificate in Software Engineering</h4>
        <h4>2021 - 2021</h4>
        <br>

        <p>This bootcamp run by Hyperion Development entailed learning Python and Java, and learning to apply
            important
            computer science, data science and software engineering principles.

            Level 1 of the course included:

            - An introduction to programming, by learning pseudo code, variables, datatypes, control structures,
            loops,
            error handling, lists and functions.
            We had to deliver a project from scratch in 3 stages, developed in Python, whereby we created a Task
            Management
            System that would enable a user to create,
            update and edit a task list. The program also required setting up a login portal to gain access.

            Level 2 of the course included:

            An introduction to the fundamentals of Java. We dived deep into data structures, creating methods,
            version
            control using Git and Github.
            A core theoretical focus was put on Agile development and the Software Process. A big focus for this
            level
            was
            on OOP (Object Oriented Programming),
            creating and updating objects for projects.

            The outcome of the course was to:

            - Build up sound theoretical knowledge of all aspects of web development

            - Learning the core fundamentals of coding in HTML and CSS

            - Building and maintaining a Wordpress website from scratch
